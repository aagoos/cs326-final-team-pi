Semester: Fall 2021

# Overview 

Our application allows users to specify ingredients in a virtual pantry, called iPantry. The application will automatically find recipes with all ingredients currently in the iPantry (and automatically excluding old ingredients) so users can quickly find recipes that use food they already have on hand. This innovative application allows you to specify the date you acquired an ingredient, and will automatically detect whether it can still be used, or if it is expired.

Users can add ingredients by filling in the textbox and optionally choosing a date. Clicking the (+) icon will add the ingredient. Clicking the small + icon will instead update the selected ingredient with the current name and date values.
