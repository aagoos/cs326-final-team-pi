## Innovative Idea

Our idea is an application that allows users to store a virtual pantry of ingredients that gets updated when they obtain new ingredients or use them up. It suggests recipes based on the available ingredients, prioritizing older or perishable ingredients to reduce food waste. Many popular recipe websites like Allrecipes (https://www.allrecipes.com/) and Tasty (https://tasty.co/) have features to search by ingredients, and a few applications even exist which allow users to create accounts to store and update the ingredients they have and suggest recipes from that, like Supercook (https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop) and Recipe Key (http://www.recipekey.com/my_pantry.php), however in all these cases, it is up to the user to make sure they are selecting recipes that use up their ingredients before they go bad. Yummly (https://www.yummly.com/virtual-pantry/support) does include features for prioritizing recipes to prevent waste, however, these features have only been pre-released for Android devices and do not exist on iOS or the general web application. Thus, this virtual pantry web app designed to prioritize expiring ingredients to prevent food waste is different from anything commonly available online.

## Important Components

Our final project has three primary functions. First, the application will suggest recipes based on available ingredients. Specifically, this means that suggested recipes contain only ingredients that are available. Second, the application will allow users to track what ingredients they currently have available. At the very least, they will be able to add and remove ingredients identified by name, but there are various ways to make this more robust including using ingredient images and tracking amounts and specific expiration dates. Third, the application will prioritize suggested recipes based on the presence of perishable or expiring ingredients.
